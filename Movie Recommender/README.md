Building a Recommender System in R

In this project, I built a recommender system that will recommend movies to users. This will show my strategy for preprocessing data, 
exploring data, and creating the system itself using 'recommenderLab'

'recommenderLab' is a R package that provides a framework to test and develop recommender algorithms. Various algorithms are supported, 
including User-based collaborative filtering (UBCF), item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF), Association rule-based recommender (AR), 
and many more. It was developed in 2016 by Micharl Hahsler.
