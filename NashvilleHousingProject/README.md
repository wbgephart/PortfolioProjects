Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

With this project, I wanted to be able to display my data cleaning process in SQL. Data cleaning is a process of navigating through a dataset,
and fixing and/or removing incorrect data so that it can become more conducive to performing data analysis. There are many opportunities for data
to be cleaned in this data set. From formatting issues, duplicates, to incomplete data or data that is entirely mislabled,
I made several changes that allowed for data anlysis to become much easier.  

Steps in this data Cleaning process
1. Standardize the date format across all data
2. Populate the property address data
3. Breaking the addresses out into individual columns by address, city, and state.
4. Changing the Y and N labels to "Yes" and "No" within the Sold As Vacant field
5. Remove Duplicates
6. Delete the unused columns within the dataset

There are several more steps that can be taken with larger data sets, but this provides a solid framework for a more basic data cleaning process,
and one that proved to be effective.
